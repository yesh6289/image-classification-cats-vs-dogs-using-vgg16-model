# image-classification-cats-vs-dogs-using-vgg16-model

Image classification is the one of the main concepts in the deep learning 
Also it has been introduced as a challenge to do it
Now to do the simple image classification I have used the vgg16 model and added 2 layers extra to it as the out is binary it has to become the only one neuron in the output layer. Before the output layer I have used another 512 neuron layer so that the output layer will be mapped from this layer and added the flatten function to it. I used the fine tuning approach to build the model.
